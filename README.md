This repository runs the code for solving fully nonlinear PDEs through gradient ascent implementation on the semilinear PDEs. To run the code use python 3.12.4 on main.py
The supporting files that need to be in the same folder as main.py are:
equation.py
coeff.py
samplepath.py
functions.py
derivation.py
neuralnets.py
visuals.py
